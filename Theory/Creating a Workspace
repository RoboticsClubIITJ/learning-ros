Creating a Catkin Workspace:
This is necessary as this is the folder where all the packages in Ros will reside. 
All the work done by you in Ros will reside in this catkin workspace.

Steps to create:
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash

Things to Remember:
1) After any change in the catkin workspace(e.g. after cloning a ROS package remember to catkin_make)
2) Remember to  source devel/setup.bash after every catkin_make

After opening a new terminal remember to enter: source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
You can also add this line to your .bashrc this will save you from entering this line in a new terminal
But I highly recommend to add this line in every new termnal you open.
