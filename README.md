# Getting Started with ROS and Gazebo

## What is ROS?
ROS, short for Robot Operating System, is open-source software that serves as a vital framework for robotic applications. While not a conventional operating system, it functions similarly, managing multiple nodes, processing commands, and delivering results to the robot. ROS plays a central role in enabling various robot-related applications like MOVEit and Gazebo to function effectively.

## What is Gazebo?
Gazebo is a simulated environment for testing and developing robot applications. It provides a virtual world where engineers and developers can use simulated robots to test their code. This approach avoids the risk of damaging physical robots during testing and saves both time and effort in the development process.

## Installation of ROS

At the time of writing, there are two primary versions of ROS available:

1. ROS Melodic
2. ROS Noetic

### Installation of ROS Melodic
To install ROS Melodic, you will need Ubuntu 18.04. Follow the installation instructions provided here: [ROS Melodic Installation Instructions for Ubuntu 18.04](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)

### Installation of ROS Noetic
For ROS Noetic, you'll need Ubuntu 20.04. The installation instructions are available here: [ROS Noetic Installation Instructions for Ubuntu 20.04](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)

## Installation of Ubuntu Software

There are two methods for installing Ubuntu:

1. Using a Virtual Machine (VM): Follow this video tutorial for Ubuntu 18.04: [VM Installation Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbmRXJJKsvs)
2. Dual Booting Your PC: Refer to this video guide for Ubuntu 18.04: [Dual Boot Installation Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5QyjHIYwTQ)

These methods are tailored for Ubuntu 18.04. You can adapt them for Ubuntu 20.04 by obtaining the corresponding installation files.

## Sources for Studying ROS
While the official ROS website provides comprehensive resources, beginners might find it challenging to grasp initially. For a more approachable introduction, I recommend exploring the YouTube channel called [The Construct](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6Lag-vv25fTX3e11mVY1Q). They offer excellent video tutorials and playlists to help you get started.

Additional instructions and resources can be found in the theory folder of this repository.

## Why Study ROS?
The decision to study ROS is a personal one, but it's worth noting that ROS represents a valuable skillset to acquire. In the wake of events like the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing reliance on automation and robotics. The demand for skilled ROS developers is expected to increase significantly. Currently, there is a shortage of ROS professionals compared to fields like web development, app development, and machine learning/deep learning.

## Job Opportunities Related to ROS
Extensive research has shown that many of the world's leading companies have dedicated robotics development divisions. Companies such as Amazon and Google invest heavily in robotics research, and they rely on ROS as a fundamental part of their software infrastructure. While a short course of 2-3 months in ROS may not make you immediately eligible for such positions, specializing in this field and pursuing an MS degree from a foreign university can significantly enhance your prospects.
